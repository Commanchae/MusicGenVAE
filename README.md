# MusicGenVAE
This is my version of the Variational Autoencoder Implementation created as part of the 'Music Generation with Deep Learning' project within a student team. Note that the extract does not include the data, and so the files would not run out-of-the-box. This is meant to serve as a collection of most of the functions we used to create a variational autoencoder.

There are unlisted files that serve to process the initial MIDI data (from another repository) into different musical scales and convert piano rolls into MIDI files and vice versa.

# Sample
The following are links to examples of music generated via the model. (Links to a Google-drive-hosted file).
